A conversation with my son - April 2, 2016

Jackson: Daddy?

Me: Yes, Jackson?

Jackson: Guess what?

Me: What, Jackson?!?!

Jackson: I got my Hebrew name last night!

Me: I know, Jackson. I was there. It was very exciting. You did a fantastic job!

Jackson: Thanks, Daddy. I'm hebrew now!

Me: Ha. No, Jewish. Slight difference. But the name is Hebrew.

Jackson: Oh, I see. Jewish. That's cool. I'm a real member of the tribe!

Me: Ha, that's right!

Jackson: My hebrew name is Avraham Liron.

Me: I know, Jackson. Like I said, I was there. And your mom and I picked out the name for you.

Jackson: Oh, yeah. I forgot. That's cool. It's a funky name, right?

Me: Ummm, sure, Jackson. It's super funky.

Jackson: That's probably going to be my stage name.

Me: Your stage name?

Jackson: Yeah, when I'm the bass player in some super funky band... which shouldn't be too long from now.... my stage name will be Abe Liron. Pronounced "Leee-rone!".Funky!

Me: I see. Well, let's get settled with Jackson for the time being, alright? Technically I really haven't even heard you say _that_ name yet.

Jackson: Ouch. Low-blow, daddy! I'm getting there. Have patience. I mean, c'mon, I'm already walking and talking before my first birthday.... which just happens to be tomorrow!

Me: You're right, big guy. Your Mom and I are very proud of all your "pre-1-year-old" accomplishments. You've really got a great set of skills.

Jackson: Thanks, Daddy. Also, I've got great rhythm!

Me: That you do, Jackson. Great rhythm.

Jackson: Jackson Abe Leee-rone Dubois. Super funky baby.

Me: I dig it, Jackson!

Jackson: Right on, Daddy! L'chaim!
